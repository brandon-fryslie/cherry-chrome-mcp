{"id":"cherry-chrome-mcp-2ca","title":"connect tool should handle existing connections gracefully","description":"When a connection with the same ID already exists, the connect tool fails with 'Connection already exists. Use chrome_disconnect first.' This forces a multi-step workflow (disconnect then connect) for what should be a single operation.\n\n**Expected behavior:** If connection exists and URL is provided, navigate to the new URL using the existing connection. Only fail if the existing connection is actually broken.\n\n**Current behavior:** Hard failure requiring manual disconnect.\n\n**Impact:** Poor agent UX - wastes tokens and time on unnecessary back-and-forth.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-26T21:46:12.166703-07:00","created_by":"bmf","updated_at":"2026-01-26T21:46:43.861797-07:00"}
