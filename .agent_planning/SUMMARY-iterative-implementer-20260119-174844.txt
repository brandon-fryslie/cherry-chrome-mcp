Key Features Implemented:
- Natural language description matching ("login button", "email input")
- Text content matching (exact substring + keyword extraction)
- Attribute filtering (role, aria-label, data-testid with wildcards, placeholder, type)
- Spatial matching (near.selector with direction: above/below/left/right/inside)
- Tag filtering (button, input, a, etc.)
- Selector generation with stability scores (ID=95, data-testid=90, aria-label=85, etc.)
- Ranked output format (RECOMMENDED, ALTERNATIVE, FALLBACK)
- Strict stability mode (filter to high-stability selectors only)

Ready for user testing and evaluation.
