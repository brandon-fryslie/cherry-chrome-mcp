Completed: All 6 ACs (Types, Snapshot, Diff, Format, Integration, Build) | Files: 3 | Commits: 4
Tests: All passing
Cache invalidated: None (changes are purely additive, existing runtime behavior unchanged)
Status: complete

Implementation Summary:
- AC1: Added DOMSnapshot, DOMDiff, ElementSnapshot types + lastDOMSnapshot field to Connection
- AC2: Implemented captureDOMSnapshot() to capture page state (counts + key interactive elements)
- AC3: Implemented computeDOMDiff() to detect added/removed/changed elements + count deltas
- AC4: Implemented formatDOMDiff() with 5-item limit per category and count summary
- AC5: Integrated with clickElement/fillElement - snapshot before action, diff after, stored in Connection
- AC6: Build passes, tests pass (5/5 green)

Commits:
- 764ea05: feat(diffing): add DOM snapshot and diff types
- a841064: feat(diffing): add DOM snapshot capture and diff functions
- 1e37a65: feat(diffing): integrate DOM diffing with click and fill actions
- ecb42af: fix(diffing): use getConnection() instead of getActiveConnection()

Next steps: User should test manually with real pages to verify diff output quality
